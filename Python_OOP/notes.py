#  Object-Oriented Programming Terms
#
# Class         -> A blueprint for creating objects of a particular type
# Methods       -> Regular functions that are part of a class
# Attributes    -> Variables that hold data that are part of a class
# Objects       -> A specific instane of a class
# Inheritance   -> Means by which a class can inherit capabilities from another
# Composition   -> Means of building complex objects out of other objects

# Python "Magic" Methods
#
# Customize object behavior and integrate with the language
# Define how objects are represented as strings
# Control access to attribute values,both for get and set
# Build in comparison and equality testing capabilities
# Allow objects to be called like functions

# NOTE
# __init__ uses for initializing classes
# We can define functions inside class as instances
# hasattr method checks that is class have an attribute or not
# __some_props double-underscore properties are hidden form other classes
